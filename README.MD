# Project : Helping Hand

## Context
As part of an Human Centred Design course at POSTECH, my team and I were tasked with identifying a social issue in our community, and using design thinking methodology, propose a feasible solution.
The social issue we identified was the difficulty in coordinating the matching between professional care givers and those who wanted it (e.g. a family member of someone with a disability).

## What this is
We proposed a solution whereby a mobile app (under the care of state services) could be deployed to create a platform for care requesters and professional care givers to connect.
The requirements we had for our MVP:
- a matching mechanism as simple as Tinder
- comprehensive profile information requirements and filtering that give a care requester plenty of options to precisely identify their preferences in a care giver
- a scheduling tool for both requesters and givers

Contained in this repo is the android code for our protoype app. Functionally (i.e. matchmaking), the app does not work, but rather just a viewer an idea of how it would work.
